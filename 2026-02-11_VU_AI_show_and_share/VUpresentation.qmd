# Topic 1: Developing Teaching Methods {background-color="#4A90E2"}

## Using Multiple AI Tools Simultaneously

- Combining different AI assistants for different tasks
- GitHub integration for version control
- Iterative development workflow
- Collaborative approach with AI

## Creating Slides

**AI-assisted slide development:**

- Generate initial content from learning objectives
- Refine structure and flow
- Create examples and visualizations
- Polish language and formatting

## Writing an OER Book

**Open Educational Resources development:**

- Chapter-by-chapter content generation
- Consistency checking across chapters
- Creating exercises and activities
- Maintaining accessible language

## Deploying on GitHub

**Version control and collaboration:**

- Track changes in educational materials
- Enable community contributions
- Automated publishing workflows
- Transparent development process

## Creating Exam Questions

**Assessment design with AI:**

- Generate question ideas from learning objectives
- Create graphs and visualizations for questions
- Develop comprehensive answer models
- Iterate on question quality and alignment

# Topic 2: Thesis Supervision with MS Teams {background-color="#50C878"}

## Innovative Student Support

**Using Microsoft Teams for writing coaching**

Focus on **process, not just products**

## Process-Oriented Supervision

Traditional approach:
- Submit full drafts → receive feedback → revise

**New approach:**
- Continuous dialogue
- Incremental progress
- Frequent touchpoints
- Building confidence

## Benefits of Teams

- Lower threshold for questions
- Real-time feedback opportunities
- Document version tracking
- Integrated communication

## Supporting the Writing Process

- Early-stage brainstorming
- Outline development
- Paragraph-level feedback
- Reflection on progress

# Topic 3: Research with Databot {background-color="#FFB347"}

## Using AI for Research

**Exploring databot in Positron for:**

- Running statistical analyses
- Creating research reports
- Streamlining workflows

## Running Analysis with Databot

- Natural language to code translation
- Statistical test selection
- Exploratory data analysis
- Reproducible workflows in R/Python

## Creating Reports in Positron

- Automated report generation
- Integrating analysis and interpretation
- Quarto document workflows
- Publication-ready outputs

## Research Questions

**Investigating:**

- How does AI change the analysis workflow?
- What is the quality of AI-generated code?
- Can AI improve reproducibility?
- What are the learning implications?

# Bringing It Together {background-color="#9B59B6"}

## Common Threads

All three areas demonstrate:

- AI as a collaborative partner
- Focus on process and development
- Emphasis on transparency (GitHub, Teams)
- Supporting learning and growth

## The Multi-Tool Approach

**Key insight:** Different AI tools for different tasks

- Teaching development
- Student coaching
- Research workflows

Integration is essential!
